# Doxyfile 1.8.5

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = VISAdrv

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "ASYN driver for National Instruments VISA"

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces.
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

# ISIS: list your IOC/module "src", "db" and "iocBoot" directories

# The EXAMPLE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain example code fragments that are included (see the \include
# command).

# The TAGFILES tag can be used to specify one or more tag files. For each tag
# file the location of the external documentation should be added. The format of
# a tag file without this location is as follows:
# TAGFILES = file1 file2 ...
# Adding location for the tag files is done as follows:
# TAGFILES = file1=loc1 "file2 = loc2" ...
# where loc1 and loc2 can be relative or absolute paths or URLs. See the
# section "Linking to external documentation" for more information about the use
# of tag files.
# Note: Each tag file must have an unique name (where the name does NOT include
# the path). If a tag file is not located in the directory in which doxygen is
# run, you must also specify the path to the tagfile here.

# ISIS: this can be used for allowing an IOC to link to documentation for its support modules
# ISIS: syntax is a little wierd - see the ISISDAE IOC for an example

# When a file name is specified after GENERATE_TAGFILE, doxygen will create a
# tag file that is based on the input files it reads. See section "Linking to
# external documentation" for more information about the usage of tag files.

# ISIS: use the name format <iocname>_IOC.tags or <modulename>_SUPPORT.tags as appropriate 
# ISIS: also use capitals except for .tags suffix
